## ✨ Overview

**MEDORA** is an early-stage medical technology platform focused on simplifying how people store and manage their medical data.

Think of MEDORA as a **personal health drive** 📂—  
where users can securely store medical records and apply for insurance, all in one place.

## 🚀 Vision

Healthcare data is scattered, hard to manage, and often inaccessible when needed most.

**MEDORA’s goal** is to centralize medical information while ensuring:
- 🔐 Privacy  
- 🧑‍⚕️ User ownership  
- ⚡ Seamless access
